# BIDS-Rulebook

This is the rulebook for the European Union Business Information Data Space initiative.

In the business activity context, information sharing is usually tied to a specific business process. In order to make the rulebook easier to understand and implement, the Know Your Customer process whereby a financial institution like a bank accepts a business entity as it's customer, has been chosen as the default process to which the requirements introduced by the rulebook are applied.
